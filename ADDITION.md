SLogo Modification for VOOGA Analysis
====
> I plan to work on the back-end extension for SLogo, as it seems simpler to me than the front end extension given our current design.


## Estimation
- I believe this extension will take me an hour or less to complete.
- Ideally, I'll only have to create the commands (as separate classes), then modify the resources to allow for English calls to the commands.
Our back-end was built to be easily extensible with regards to adding commands, so hopefully it should not be too difficult to do that despite 
having done front end throughout the project.
